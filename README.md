# 🚀 Electric Vehicle Utility Model for Emission Reduction Potential in Germany  

This repository contains the **research** on modeling the adoption behavior of **micro electric vehicles (MEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs)** using **Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE) and advanced choice modeling techniques**. The study aims to estimate the potential adoption of light electric vehicles (LEVs) and their role in reducing emissions in Germany.

## 📌 Research Overview  

The study investigates how **individual preferences, socio-demographic factors, and latent behavioral aspects** influence the adoption of **MEVs and EVs**. A **Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE)** was designed to analyze preferences between micro electric cars and conventional electric cars.  

Key research components include:  
- **Survey-based stated choice experiment** to gather user preferences.  
- **Factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)** to uncover latent variables influencing choice behavior.  
- **Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Mixed Logit Models (MXL)** for robust preference estimation.  
- **Latent Class Models (LCM) and Hybrid Choice Models (HCM)** to capture heterogeneity in user behavior.

## 📊 Methodology
🔹 Survey Design & Data Collection
1. Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE): Survey respondents were asked to choose between micro electric cars and electric cars based on attributes such as price, range, charging infrastructure, environmental impact, and safety.
2. Sampling Strategy: The survey was weighted to ensure representation based on real-world demographics.

🔹 Data Analysis Techniques
1. Factor Analysis & Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Identified key latent variables influencing mode choice.

2. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
Validated latent constructs such as environmental concerns, mobility behavior, and vehicle knowledge.

3. Multinomial Logit Model (MNL)
Estimated baseline mode choice behavior for MEVs and EVs.

4. Mixed Logit Model (MXL)
Accounted for random preference heterogeneity in choice behavior.

5. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) & Latent Class Model (LCM)
Identified distinct consumer segments based on mode choice preferences.

6. Hybrid Choice Model (HCM)
Integrated latent behavioral variables (e.g., environmental attitudes) into the mode choice model.

## 📈 Key Findings
1. Price and charging infrastructure significantly influence the likelihood of adopting micro electric cars.
2. Environmental concerns positively impact MEV adoption, but are moderated by income and mobility habits.
3. Younger individuals and urban residents show a higher probability of adopting MEVs compared to suburban and rural users.
4. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) reveals two key user segments:
5. Early adopters highly motivated by sustainability and convenience.
6. Cost-sensitive consumers who prioritize affordability over environmental benefits.
   
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
1. Python & R for data processing and statistical modeling.
2. LimeSurvey & HTML for survey implementation.
3. Apollo package (R) for Discrete Choice Modeling.
4. Visualization libraries: ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn.
